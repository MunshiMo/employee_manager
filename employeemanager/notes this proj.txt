To start mysql server first download it 
Then need to run brew services start mysql
Then we can see in brew services list

Then the mysql will start and we can do something like "show databases;" to see what's currently running

The server can also be managed thru the activity monitor if we need to shut it down 


    if [ -f "/Users/yaser/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/Users/yaser/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/Users/yaser/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

Make sure mysql server is running and you are able to login with the designated password
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'letmein';

^this sql commands helps to ensure the password is the one we set like letmein

Need to use brew to see service : brew services list

Brew services start mysql to start

mysql -u root -p     to hop into the mysql command line for the sql server made with the letmein pw
